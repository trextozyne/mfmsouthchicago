First full stack application built non-profit for my church, using Javascript, ViewJS, Html5, CSS as front end, and Express, Node, mongoose as backend  Cloudinary for hosting pictures, 
Heroku for hosting front-end and cloud.mongodb.com as backend-storage. All in all it was meant to be hosted all free of charge.
